# Flutter project: SQLite + MobX.

## Caching API responses using SQLite and MobX.

This is simple Flutter App example to that stores the REST Api responses into a SQLite table. So intead of calling the API all the time the data can be retrieved from a local db that exists onthe App itself.

This is a very useful feature to make the app usable even in offline mode.
