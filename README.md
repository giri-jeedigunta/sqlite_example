# Flutter project: SQLite + MobX.

## Caching API responses using SQLite and MobX.

This is simple Flutter App example to that stores the REST Api responses into a SQLite table.

So intead of calling the API all the time the data can be retrieved from a local db that exists on the App itself.

This is a very useful feature to make the app usable in offline mode or if there are APIs that can be cached and not needed to frequently refreshed.
